<h2>Cap Speech</h2>
<p>They almost have what they want. <strong><u>Absolute control</u></strong>. 
They shot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury"
target="_blank" title="Nick Fury Wikipedia">Nick Fury</a> and it won't end there. 
If you launch those Helicarriers today

but the price of freedom is high, it always has been,
</p>And it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it.
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.
